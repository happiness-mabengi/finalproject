        <h2>How to actually make it</h2>
        <img src="./time.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally
                so that you end up having 4 thin chicken breasts.
                Season them with salt and pepper!
            </li>
            <li>Beat an egg into a shallow bowl with 1 tablespoon 
                of water. Add flour to another bowl and the breadcrumbs 
                to a third bowl. Coat the chicken on both sides in 
                the flour, then egg wash, and then breadcrumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons of oil
                in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken 
                and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, or until 
                cooked through. Set aside to the side.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to a medium low. Add chicken broth, cream
                juice from the lemons and capers. Season with salt and
                pepper if needed. Allow the sauce to cook and bubble for 
                3-5 minutes. Then place the chicken back to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>You can serve this with any type of side you want. 
                Preferably with mashed potatoes or hot cooked pasta.
            </li>
        </ul>
